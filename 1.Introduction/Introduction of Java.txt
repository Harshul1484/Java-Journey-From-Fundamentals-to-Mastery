1. Versatile and Platform-Independent:
Java is renowned for its ability to run on various platforms without modification. Its "write once, run anywhere" mantra allows developers to create applications that can seamlessly execute on different operating systems, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that acts as an abstraction layer.

2. Object-Oriented Approach:
Java is a fully object-oriented programming language, which promotes modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance of code. It encapsulates data and behavior within objects, fostering a structured and organized coding style.

3. Robust and Reliable:
Java's design emphasizes strong type-checking and exception handling, helping developers catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This leads to more reliable and stable applications that are less prone to crashes and unpredictable behavior.

4. Extensive Standard Library:
Java provides an extensive standard library, offering pre-built classes and methods for common programming tasks. This saves developers time by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel for every project.

5. Community and Resources:
Java boasts a massive and active community of developers, which translates into a wealth of resources such as documentation, tutorials, forums, and libraries. This community-driven support system can be invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.

6. Security Features:
Security is a top priority in Java's design. Its built-in security features, such as the bytecode verification process, prevent malicious code from causing harm. This makes Java a popular choice for developing secure applications, especially in areas like online banking and e-commerce.

7. Multithreading and Concurrency:
Java's support for multithreading and concurrency enables developers to create applications that can efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This is crucial for building responsive and performance-oriented applications, especially in scenarios like web servers and multimedia applications.

8. Continuous Evolution:
Java has a long history of evolution, consistently introducing new features and improvements. Regular updates ensure that Java remains relevant and competitive in the ever-changing world of programming languages.

9. Industry Adoption:
Java is widely used in various industries, from enterprise applications to mobile app development (Android), scientific research, and more. This broad adoption means that skills in Java can open doors to diverse career opportunities.

10. Open Source Philosophy:
Java's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation. The availability of the OpenJDK (Java Development Kit) allows developers to contribute to the language's growth and customization.

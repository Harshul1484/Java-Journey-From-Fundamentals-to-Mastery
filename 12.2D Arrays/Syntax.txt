2D Array is similar to 2D matrices

type[][]arrayName = new type[row][colimns];

For example, if you want to create a 2D array of integers with 3 rows and 5 columns:
eg.: int[][] number=new int[3][5];

This sets up a 2D array named `numbers` that can store integers in a 3x5 grid (3 rows and 5 columns).



>> 2D Arrays in Java:
A 2D array in Java is like a table with rows and columns. 
It lets you store data in a grid format, where each cell can hold a value. 
It's a collection of arrays where each array represents a row, and the elements within that array represent the columns.

2D arrays can be very useful when you need to organize data in a structured way, such as representing a chessboard, a spreadsheet, an image's pixels, and more.
